// Route Groups
// The hierarchy of the app folder maps directly to URL paths. But it’s possible to break out of this pattern by creating a route group. Route groups can be used to:

// Organize routes without affecting the URL structure.
// Opt a route segment out of a layout.
// Create multiple root layouts by splitting the application.

// Convention
// A route group can be created by wrapping a folder’s name in parenthesis: (folderName)

// Note: The naming of route groups are only for organizational purposes since they do not affect the URL path.

// Example: Opting a route out of a layout

// To opt a route out of a layout, create a new route group (e.g. (fleet)) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. lists).
