// Regular Layouts

// You can also create a layout that only applies to a part of your application by adding a layout.svelte file inside a specific folder.

// Layout Components are the default export of layout.svelte
// Layout Components must accept a children prop.

// When a layout component is rendered, the children prop will be populated with a child layout (if it exists further down the subtree) or a page
